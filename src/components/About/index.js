        Hello! My name is Duncan Byrne, I am a web developer from Long Island, New York. I have been coding and building websites for almost two years. I enjoy the process of learning
        different technologies, and putting them to work. I hope to one day work on developing video games, building financial projects and overall just having fun while coding.
        </p>
        <p>
        I have recently graduated from the University of Columbia's coding bootcamp where I learned in demand skills, to advance my career going forward. Overall I am looking to land a job where I can 
        continue to learn and grow as a developer, while working on great projects with great people!
